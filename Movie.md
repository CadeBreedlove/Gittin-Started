**National Treasure** is a 2004 American action-adventure film released by Walt Disney Pictures.
It was written by Jim Kouf and the Wibberleys, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Jon Turteltaub.
It is the first film in the **National Treasure** franchise and stars *Nicolas Cage*, Harvey Keitel, Jon Voight, Diane Kruger, Sean Bean, Justin Bartha, and Christopher Plummer.
*Cage* plays Benjamin Franklin Gates, a historian and amateur cryptographer searching for a huge lost treasure of precious metals, jewelry, artwork, statues, and many other historic artifacts accumulated over time, becoming a massive stockpile.
All of it was eventually hidden away by American Freemasons during the American Revolutionary War.
A coded, unseen map, placed on the back of the Declaration of Independence points to the secret location of this "**national treasure**", but Gates is not alone in his quest: Whoever can steal the Declaration, find the map, and decode it first, will discover the greatest treasure ever accumulated in history.
